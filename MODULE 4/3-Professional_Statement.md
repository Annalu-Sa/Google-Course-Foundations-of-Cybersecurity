I am a Brazilian Engineer student at UFRJ who is interested about information security and enjoy searching for solutions that can positively impact an organization as well as the people it serves. I place a high value on maintaining a strong security posture to help protect sensitive information and mitigate risk.

## Objective

My journey in engineer until now has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, eletronics, IoT, hardware and programming. I am eager to learn many things while in university in order to decide my career path.
